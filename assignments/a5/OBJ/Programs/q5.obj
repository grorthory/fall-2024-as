define A = class
  static x = 3
  method foo = proc() .bar(x)
  method bar = proc(x) *(x, x)
end

define B = class extends A
  static x = 1
  % Modify to call A's bar.
  method foo = proc() <super>.bar(x)
  method bar = proc(x) +(x, x)
end

% Add code to test your solution
define test=new B
.<test>foo()
%evaluates to 9 and not 2, meaning it's using A's foo
